## What is Platform Engineering?

Platform engineering is a set of practices and tools used to build and maintain the underlying infrastructure and services that support modern applications. Platform engineers create a layer of abstraction between the application and the infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on building applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

Platform engineering involves creating and managing a range of services, including compute, storage, networking, security, and monitoring. These services are typically provided by cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. Platform engineers work with these providers to configure and manage these services to meet the needs of their applications.

Platform engineering also involves creating and managing tools and processes that enable developers to build and deploy applications more efficiently. This includes tools for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IAC), and containerization.

## Why is Platform Engineering Important?

Platform engineering is important because it enables developers to focus on building applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. By creating a layer of abstraction between the application and the infrastructure, platform engineers allow developers to build applications faster and more efficiently.

Platform engineering also provides a range of benefits for organizations, including:

1. Improved scalability: Platform engineering enables organizations to scale their applications quickly and easily by providing a range of scalable services and infrastructure.

1. Automation: Automation is critical to the success of internal developer platforms. Automated processes enable developers to focus on building applications instead of managing infrastructure and services.
1. Standardization: Standardization is important for maintaining consistency and reducing complexity. Internal developer platforms should provide a standardized set of services and infrastructure, making it easier for developers to build and deploy applications.
1. Integration: Internal developer platforms should integrate with existing tools and processes, making it easier for developers to adopt and use the platform.

### Anti-patterns of Internal Developer Platforms:

1. Over-centralization: Over-centralization can lead to bottlenecks and slow down the development process. Internal developer platforms should be designed to be distributed and decentralized, enabling developers to access the services and infrastructure they need from anywhere.
1. Lack of flexibility: Internal developer platforms should be flexible enough to support a range of use cases and technologies. A lack of flexibility can limit the effectiveness of the platform.
1. Poor user experience: Internal developer platforms should be easy to use and provide a good user experience. A poor user experience can discourage developers from using the platform.

### Who are these engineering platforms for?

Internal developer platforms are designed for developers and development teams. These platforms provide developers with the tools, services, and infrastructure they need to build, test, and deploy applications quickly and easily. Internal developer platforms are also designed to reduce the friction that developers often face when building applications. By providing a self-service, automated, and standardized platform, developers can focus on building applications instead of managing infrastructure and services.

### How does the use of internal developer platforms reduce developer friction?

Internal developer platforms reduce developer friction by providing developers with the tools, services, and infrastructure they need to build, test, and deploy applications quickly and easily. By providing a self-service, automated, and standardized platform, developers can focus on building applications instead of managing infrastructure and services.

Internal developer platforms also enable developers to collaborate more effectively. By providing a single platform for building and deploying applications, developers can share code, test results, and deployment artifacts with their peers. This collaboration can reduce the time and effort required to build and deploy applications.

Finally, internal developer platforms can improve the quality and reliability of applications. By providing a range of tools and processes for testing and deployment, internal developer platforms can help developers build and deploy applications more reliably and with higher quality. This can reduce the number of bugs and errors in applications, resulting in a better experience for end-users.
